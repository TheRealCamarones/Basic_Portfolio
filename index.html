    <!--Brief information about myself-->
    <p>"We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honored dead. And yet it should be noted that in the
        midst of our sorrow, this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world; a world that
        our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish. He did not feel this sacrifice a vain or empty one,
        and we will not debate his profound wisdom at these proceedings. Of my friend, I can only say this: of all the
        souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most… human." ~ James Tiberius Kirk</p>
