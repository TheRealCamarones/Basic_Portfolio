            <!--Brief information about myself-->
            <p>My name is Cameron Walther and I am a student at the UNC Charlotte Coding Bootcamp. I
                attended
                the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire where I earned a Bachelor's of Business Administration
                with a
                major in Marketing in the Professional Sales Emphasis. During my time there I was a member of the
                Sales
                Team, participating in mock role play sales scenarios in a competitive environment. After college I
                moved
                to Dallas, Texas to work for McAfee, but I found no happiness there. Shortly after I went back into
                the
                restaurant industry, a position I had worked in throughout college. I believe the coding bootcamp
                will
                help
                me use my excellent logic and problem solving skills to provide a new direction for my life.</p>
            <p>In my free time I love to read, do outdoor activities, play video games and watching Star Trek. My
                favorite books are The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand and Moneyball by Michael Lewis. During my time in
                Austin I loved going to float the San Marco river, kayaking on Ladybird Lake and spending time
                listening to live music on patios. I've played a lot of great video games this year from God of War to
                Spider-Man and Red Dead Redemption 2, but I also love phone games. I find the mobile games really
                fascinating because we're learning the skills in this bootcamp to create them ourselves eventually. I
                know it's a cliche and a stereotype at times in this industry to love Star Trek, but it's in my blood
                to love Star Trek. Both of my parents grew up as huge Trekkies and although they divorced when I was
                young they both raised me to be the same. My mom even made a Commander William Riker costume for
                Halloween when I was 4!</p>
