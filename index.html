        <p id="float" class="mainfont">"We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honored dead. And yet
            it should
            be noted that in the
            midst of our sorrow, this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world; a world
            that
            our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish. He did not feel this sacrifice a vain or empty
            one,
            and we will not debate his profound wisdom at these proceedings. Of my friend, I can only say this: of all
            the
            souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the mostâ€¦ human." ~ James Tiberius Kirk</p>
