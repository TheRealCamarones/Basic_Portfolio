            <!--Brief information about myself-->
            <p id="mainbio">My name is Cameron Walther and I am a student at the UNC Charlotte Coding Bootcamp. I attended
                the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire where I earned a Bachelor's of Business Administration with a
                major in Marketing in the Professional Sales Emphasis. During my time there I was a member of the Sales
                Team, participating in mock role play sales scenarios in a competitive environment. After college I moved
                to Dallas, Texas to work for McAfee, but I found no happiness there. Shortly after I went back into the
                restaurant industry, a position I had worked in throughout college. I believe the coding bootcamp will help
                me use my excellent logic and problem solving skills to provide a new direction for my life. Thanks for
                coming to my page, I hope you like what you see!</p>
