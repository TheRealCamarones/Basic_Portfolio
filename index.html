                <!--Brief information about myself-->
                <p id="bio">My name is Cameron Walther and I am a student at the UNC Charlotte Coding Bootcamp. I
                    attended
                    the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire where I earned a Bachelor's of Business Administration
                    with a
                    major in Marketing in the Professional Sales Emphasis. During my time there I was a member of the
                    Sales
                    Team, participating in mock role play sales scenarios in a competitive environment. After college I
                    moved
                    to Dallas, Texas to work for McAfee, but I found no happiness there. Shortly after I went back into
                    the
                    restaurant industry, a position I had worked in throughout college. I believe the coding bootcamp
                    will
                    help
                    me use my excellent logic and problem solving skills to provide a new direction for my life. Thanks
                    for
                    coming to my page, I hope you like what you see!</p>
